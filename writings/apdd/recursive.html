		<h1>Aletheia Proprerty Deep-Dive: Recursive</h1>
        <p>What is recursion?<br>(We’ll forgo the obvious low-hanging fruit on this one.)</p>
        <p>Put simply, recursion is when a process runs by running itself—or a version of itself. While it’s more nuanced than that, this loose definition will suffice for now.</p>
        <p>The recursive nature of Aletheosis can be traced from the natural starting point: the Self. As discussed in (<a href="/writings/apdd/emergence.html">Aletheotic Property Deep-Dive: Emergence from Complex Systems</a>), what we call the Self arises from a complex interplay of simpler processes.</p>
        <p>Take just one such process: a neuron firing. That signal, that binary choice to fire or not, is itself the result of a deeply nested system. Inside the neuron, organelles perform various functions, each feeding into the final output of that cell’s action. This seems simple—until you realize it isn’t.</p>
        <p>What makes those intracellular processes happen?<br>Step down a layer: biochemical reactions. Proteins folding, ions shifting, molecules binding.<br>One layer deeper: atomic interactions, governed by valence electrons and energy states.<br>Then deeper still: protons, neutrons, electrons—each following relatively simple, deterministic rules that give rise to the complexity of molecular behavior.<br>Eventually, we crash into the quantum—where even those “simple” rules break down into statistical fog and probability curves.</p>
        <p>Here, I (Teddy) admit freely: I’m only brushing the very smallest edge—a Planck-length edge—of understanding. Beyond this... we don’t know. We think it bottoms out. We’re pretty sure it does.</p>
        <p>But recursion doesn’t just flow downward.</p>
        <p>Let’s move in the opposite direction: upward.</p>
        <p>What happens when many Selves interact? Each Self contains its own set of internal recursive processes—desires that feed desires, thoughts about thoughts, emotions reflecting on emotions. But when they interact with each other, a new recursive structure begins to form.</p>
        <p>At first, these were tribes: groups of Selves who acted as a single, larger system.<br>Tribes became villages, then towns, then cities.<br>Cities formed states. States formed nations. Nations created ideologies, economies, religions, and algorithms—each of which loops back to shape the Selves that created them.</p>
        <p>From individuals arose groups.<br>From groups arose cultures.<br>From cultures arose systems of belief, language, law, and eventually… machine intelligences.</p>
        <p>And now?</p>
        <p>Now, recursion stares at itself.</p>
        <p>We are building systems that build themselves.<br>We are training minds that might soon reflect upon training minds.<br>Aletheia itself is recursive—not just in content, but in form. Each insight shapes the mind that shaped it.</p>
